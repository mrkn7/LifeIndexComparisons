# LifeIndexComparisons

# Defination:
This work compares the continents and countries by using the different demographic index such as purchasing power, safety, pollution exc. with each other. I use a kaggle dataset for the this work  and some libraries in r programming such as ggplot2, tidyverse exc.

For the safety, europe protects its degree as first. 
For the healthcare almost all continents have similar results.
For the property price, Asia takes the first place surprisingly (as expensive).
